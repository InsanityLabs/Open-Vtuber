# Open-Vtuber Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development phases for the Open-Vtuber project.

## Phase 1: Core System Foundation (Current Focus)

This phase focuses on building the essential backend components that drive the AI's personality, memory, and safety.

*   **LLM Integration:**
    *   Integrate LM Studio with DeepSeek R1 7B and SesameAILabs CSM.
    *   Implement the basic response generation pipeline.
    *   Develop the emotion tag system (`<happy>`, `<sad>`, etc.) for expressive output.
*   **Memory System:**
    *   Integrate local Mem0 for context retention.
    *   Develop mechanisms for managing global and user-specific memories.
    *   Implement basic conversation history tracking.
*   **Content Filtering:**
    *   Design and implement the initial custom filter system for content moderation.

## Phase 2: Interaction and Control

This phase focuses on enabling interaction with external platforms and managing the system.

*   **MCP Server:**
    *   Develop the core MCP server architecture.
    *   Implement communication protocols for interacting with streaming platforms (e.g., chat).
    *   Create basic stream interaction handlers.

## Phase 3: Animation and Visuals

This phase brings the VTuber to life visually.

*   **VTuber Animation System:**
    *   Develop the custom VTS driver.
    *   Implement the persistent connection for real-time control.
    *   Create the lip synchronization and facial expression mapping based on LLM output (including emotion tags).

## Phase 4: Integration, Testing, and Refinement

This phase involves bringing all components together, testing thoroughly, and refining the system.

*   **System Integration:** Combine Core System, MCP Server, and Animation System.
*   **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing (unit, integration, user acceptance).
*   **Refinement:** Address bugs, optimize performance, and improve user experience based on testing feedback.

## Phase 5: Future Development and Release

This phase focuses on long-term goals and preparing for release.

*   **Advanced Features:** Explore and implement features like the custom LLM, enhanced memory/context handling, and expanded animation capabilities.
*   **Documentation:** Finalize user and developer documentation.
*   **Release:** Prepare for the initial public release.
*   **Ongoing Maintenance:** Establish processes for updates, bug fixes, and community contributions.
